## Gaming System

There are two healthbars, 'one for your healt and the other for monster health' and the button 'Start game'. When you click this button, the game starts and another buttons replace this one:
- Attack: both monster and player commit some attacks and the helathbars start to decline.
- Special attack: it is something like ultimate for player, no actions are commited while ultimate is being used, so it's only player who makes some damage to monster.
- heal: you can use this skill only three times during the match .
- give up: you can finish the game and after clicking this button you return to the main menu where you can click the button 'Start game' again and try yourself one more time.
